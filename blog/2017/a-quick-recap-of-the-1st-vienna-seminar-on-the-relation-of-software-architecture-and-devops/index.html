The goal was to create a Dagstuhl-like, by-invitation event where we wanted to bring together academics and practitioners working somewhere in the vicinity of software architecture, cloud application development, DevOps, continuous delivery, and software experimentation. We were a bit frisky with the event date‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe deliberately set the event to happen in the last week before Christmas, partly because meeting rooms at University of Vienna were easy to get at this time, partly because we hoped that most academics would be free of teaching. In the end, I was extremely happy with the turnout‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe managed to attract 48 distinguished participants, about half of which were practitioners.</p> <p>The seminar ran over 4 full days, alternating between half-hour keynote talks, 15-minute lightning talks, and breakout discussion sessions. Uwe and his team organized awesome social events every evening, including an invitation to a gala dinner in the city hall and a visit to one of Vienna‚Äôs famous Christmas markets. There was significant tweeting, so a good way to follow the entire event is by reviewing the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/vss17" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#vss17 hashtag</a> on¬†Twitter.</p> <p>Overall, our presentations and discussions seemed to circle around a few (interconnected) topics:</p> <p><strong>Software architecture, and how much of it we need in an agile, fast-moving continuous deployment projects</strong></p> <p>Maybe the most heated discussions centered around the notion of software architecture. For instance, <a href="https://www.vanheesch.net" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Uwe van Heesch</a> still sees a lot of need for and value in documentation. Other participants have argued in discussion sessions that explicit, up-front architectural planning and documentation is basically dead, especially in fast-moving DevOps / cloud computing projects. Most participants don‚Äôt really seem believe anymore in traditional top-down, UML-centric architectural planning for such projects.</p> <h3>Cesare Pautasso on Twitter</h3> <p>VSS17 Prescriptive vs Descriptive documentation</p> <p><strong>The value of APIs and ecosystems</strong></p> <p>We had a set of presentations and discussions around standards, APIs, and ecosystems. <a href="http://dret.net/netdret/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Erik Wilde</a> has observed (lamented?) that ‚Äústandard‚Äù has by now become almost a dirty word in the community. There were also some interesting discussions around the upcoming PSD2 regulation, which will force European banks to provide APIs to their core services. We discussed what strategies banks fundamentally have to deal with this (provide a great API to build an ecosystem? provide a by-design horrible API to keep a walled garden around their services?).</p> <h3>Janne J√§rvinen on Twitter</h3> <p>Pact framework - How to manage continuous integration in the cloud RT @xLeitix: Consumer-side pact at #vss17 https://t.co/eQXGtqX9Gz #devops</p> <p><strong>Micro- and Nanoservices</strong></p> <p>There was fairly broad agreement that Microservices are here to stay, and fundamentally important to deliver new features reliably and fast. <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/staff/eberhard-wolff/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Eberhard Wolff</a> pointed us to a very interesting <a href="http://ewolff.com/microservices-demos.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">repository of microservice examples</a> that he is maintaining for this books. <a href="http://www.pautasso.info" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Cesare Pautasso</a> gave a very interesting talk about one challenge with microservices, namely that it‚Äôs theoretically impossible to back them up in a way that no data inconsistencies are possible after disaster recovery. We also had some breakout discussions related to serverless computing(e.g., AWS Lambda) as one promising implementation technique for very small microservices. There was a lively debate how ‚Äúnew‚Äù and/or important technologies such as AWS Lambda actually are. Eberhard commented that the incredible hype in industry is at least a good indicator that there is something fundamentally relevant in the serverless movement.</p> <h3>Robert Chatley on Twitter</h3> <p>Very nice talk from @pautasso at #vss17 on disaster recovery for microservices.</p> <p><strong>Continuous integration and delivery pipelines</strong></p> <p>As far as I could tell, most participants assumed it as a given that you <em>need</em> a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to move fast. We had a number of different talks and discussions on CI builds, and how to set up CD pipelines. Eberhard has argued that even if you can‚Äôt release continuously due to your domain, the technical benefits of CI and CD alone are worth it for many companies. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/posts/hashcollision" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">David Lebutsch</a> mentioned that he sees security as an important driver for continuous deployment‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif you have a security problem and you can‚Äôt roll out a fix quickly, you have a big problem. <a href="http://mcis.polymtl.ca/bram.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bram Adams</a>, <a href="http://shanemcintosh.org" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shane McIntosh</a>, and others talked about CI builds, build failures, performance testing in pipelines, code reviews, and other similar¬†topics.</p> <h3>mir on Twitter</h3> <p>Quite a lot of machine-years used daily for building at goog says beam adams at #vss17</p> <p><strong>A/B testing, and the limits¬†thereof</strong></p> <p>Another focal point of the seminar was on software experimentation and A/B testing. <a href="http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/kevic.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Katja Kevic</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/bmurphy/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Brendan Murphy</a> talked about experimentation in Microsoft, and <a href="https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/lawilli3" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Laurie Williams</a> reflected on a relevant Silicon Valley workshop that she has been organizing for a few years. Interestingly, a lot of discussion on the topic nowadays seems to be around when not to do it, and what the downsides and ethical challenges are. The hype certainly seems to have dampened a little¬†bit.</p> <h3>Florian Rosenberg on Twitter</h3> <p>AB testing insights from Bing and Office presented at #vss17 by folks from @MSFTResearch</p> <p><strong>Cultural issues</strong></p> <p>Finally, even though this was not the explicit topic of any presentation, there was often an undercurrent of ‚Äúculture‚Äù to many of the technical discussions at the seminar. It is clear that continuous delivery and deployment are not only technical challenges, but often need to deal with team culture and organisational management. Techniques such as A/B testing interfere with how products are typically designed, and microservices as well as DevOps change how software teams¬†operate.</p> <h3>Eberhard Wolff on Twitter</h3> <p>Quite a lot of the talks also cover culture in DevOps and Continuous Delivery. üëç #vss17</p> <p>Now, after the seminar is finished, it‚Äôs time for us to consider whether we want to run this back, either next or in the following year. Initial participant feedback seems to suggest that most felt the seminar was worth their time, so we are definitely open to a second iteration in the foreseeable future. Personally, I have certainly learned a lot this¬†week!</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e2a013ce1555" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
