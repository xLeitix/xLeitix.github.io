All data is as of July 8th, 2018.</p> <p><strong>How many submissions does JSS receive</strong>?</p> <p>If there is one thing you should remember for JSS, it’s that we receive <em>many</em> submissions. To be exact: since 2014, JSS has <strong>received between 1051 and 1223</strong> (!) manuscripts per year, and accepted between 165 and 241 of them.</p> <p><strong>This makes our acceptance rate vary between 17% and 19% </strong>(not counting the currently running year).</p> <p>Interestingly, in 2017, the number of submissions was going down slightly, and so was the number of accepted papers. For 2018 it is still a bit early to tell, but it looks like the number of submissions will increase slightly in comparison to 2017.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iRgfgLLYnOQAvWQdNgkG5w.png"></figure> <p>To cope with this pretty overwhelming submission load, JSS uses a <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-systems-and-software/editorial-board" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">71-persons strong editorial board</a>, including two Editors-in-Chief, and 27 (senior or regular) associate editors.</p> <p><strong>JSS acceptance rate in details</strong></p> <p>For journals, the acceptance rate (or, conversely, the rejection rate) consists of two separate components. Some papers are <em>desk-rejected</em>, that is, rejected by the Editors-in-Chief before even being sent to peer review. Other papers are rejected after peer review.</p> <p>As we note above, JSS has had a fairly consistent overall rejection rate hovering around 82% for years (which trivially translates to an acceptance rate of about 18%, give or take). The larger part of these (between 45% and 50% of all submissions) are desk rejected. In the first half of 2018 the rate went up to about 85%. One thing is for sure: it’s not easy getting published in JSS.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CFkUPOrT1PP_7q5Gyf7lTQ.png"></figure> <p><strong>How long does JSS take to make decisions?</strong></p> <p>An often-discussed aspect of journal reviewing is how long it takes between manuscript submission until authors learn about a decision. This is especially true for a journal which gets as many submissions as JSS.</p> <p>Here, three different time frames are of relevance: (1) the time until an Editor-in-Chief makes a decision of whether to desk reject, (2) the time until the first review round is completed, and (3) the time until a final editorial decision (reject or accept) is made.</p> <p>JSS has traditionally taken about 1.5 weeks to make a first editorial decision, a little over 16 weeks for the first decision, and a little over 28 weeks (on average) until review is completed. Once a decision is made, things typically move quickly — the average article is online <strong>less than a week</strong> after a final camera-ready version has been sent in by the authors.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tq9RDnfxCgVUNnE_rLQhXw.png"></figure> <p>From Elsevier’s bibliometrics site we can also learn that the time for reviewers to make a decision varies between 10 and 16 weeks.
