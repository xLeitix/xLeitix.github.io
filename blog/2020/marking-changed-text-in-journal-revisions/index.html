<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I recently went on a bit of Twitter rage after reviewing the revision of a 40-page manuscript, where the authors in no way indicated in the manuscript what they had actually changed.</p> <h3>Philipp Leitner on Twitter</h3> <p>I swear I would be accepting twice as many review invitations if journals would ask authors to use a different color for changed text in revisions. It boggles my mind that this is so rarely done. /c @JSSoftware @ISTJrnal @ieeesoftware @emsejournal</p> <p>In the ensuing Twitter conversation, some people have asked me for how I normally mark up changed text in revisions. What I do is <em>really </em>low-tech: I simply use a different color for new or importantly changed text.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xSzotHqGmh-MSxUybTJ4wA.png"><figcaption>Example from the revised version of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2885497" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this paper</a></figcaption></figure> <p>I find this approach to be very easy to do and less visually jarring than a full change log, while still making abundantly clear what we have updated in a manuscript.</p> <p>An appropriately low-effort way to do this is to create specific LaTeX markup for changed text, like so (requires the color package to be imported):</p> <pre>\newcommand{\rev}[1]{\textcolor{blue}{#1}}</pre> <p>You can then simply demark your changes and additions while writing:</p> <pre>Our approach outperforms all other approaches by 100%.<br>\rev{My father says so as well.}<br>Hence, the world will be changed after this manuscript is accepted.</pre> <p>This has the advantage that you don’t have to cumbersomely remove the markup for the final version — you can simply set the text color for \rev back to black and re-compile.</p> <p>This approach works well for text and text-like content (e.g., table values), but breaks down for figures. For these, I use another custom markup that draws blue lines above and beyond a changed figure (see also the right-hand side of the screenshot above). The markup to generate these frames is a custom environment based on the <em>mdframed</em> and <em>ntheorem </em>packages, and can be used like this:</p> <pre>% in preamble<br>\usepackage{mdframed}<br>\usepackage{ntheorem}<br>\theoremstyle{nonumberplain}<br>\newmdtheoremenv[%<br>  linecolor=blue,<br>  linewidth=2pt,<br>  rightline=false,<br>  leftline=false]{figrev}{}</pre> <pre>%<br>%  ...<br>%</pre> <pre>% in document<br>\begin{figrev}<br>\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/litsearch.pdf}<br>\end{figrev}</pre> <p>The above code should be fairly self-explanatory and easy to adapt in case you want to change how your markup looks. Sadly, these tags you’ll actually have to manually remove before handing in your final camera-ready version (or you combine it with <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/ifthen?lang=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ifthen</a>, which I don’t want to get into here).</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8583136a4738" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
