I am an Associate Professor of Software Engineering at [Chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se) and [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/en), Sweden. I lead the [Internet Computing and Emerging Technologies Lab (ICET-lab)](http://www.icet-lab.eu/). I am also currently the head of the Software Engineering 2 unit at Chalmers and the University of Gothenburg, consisting of 6 faculty members and roughly 15 PhD students and postdocs distributed over both universities.

I hold a PhD degree from Vienna University of Technology (in business informatics, focussing on cost-aware service composition).

My current research interests are software performance engineering, especially in a cloud computing context. My research is funded primarily through the Swedish research foundation VR and by the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org). Historically, I have also received significant funding through the Chalmers ICT Area of Advance, VINNOVA, the Horizon Europe programme, and the Swiss National Science Foundation.

I have published some 150 peer-reviewed publications on (micro-)services, cloud systems, and empirical software engineering, leading to an h-index of 45 as tracked by [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wZ9f8CAAAAAJ&hl=en).
